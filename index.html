            Welcome to my portfolio! My name is <span class="name_intro">Nirajan Khatiwada</span> and I am the admin and founder of <span class="org_intro">नेपाली हाँस्यचित्र संस्थान</span>. Our mission is to entertain people and make them smile always. With over 3 years of experience in the social media handling and IT sector, I have developed a passion for graphics designing.
I hold a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science and Information Technology, currently in my first year at <span class="college_intro">Amrit Science Campus (ASCOL)</span>. My professional and personal goal is to <span class="mission_intro">digitalize happiness</span> and create the world of my dream. I possess strong skills in graphic designing, as well as editing funny clips, videos, and photos for social media.
On this website, you will find samples of my IT-related work on Github, as well as my entertaining blog. My work samples showcase my abilities in designing postcards, pomplates, birthday cards, and other graphics. My knowledge in IT combined with my graphic design skills allows me to provide innovative and creative solutions for my clients.
